V1.1
	1.0 - major update to the doc (new section, new mechanics / ideas, etc)
	0.1 - minor update to the doc (fixed mistakes, reverted mechanics / ideas, small updates, etc)

IMPORTANT NOTE: Panel activation highly depends on how much the player has `explored` (due to visleafs), and the panel amount in the map.
		EXAMPLE:
			In _example_chamber_.vmf, if the player doesn't move far from the spawn, they would only be able to activate panels very close to them.
			If the player has `explored` the map (entered all the visleafs), the player can activate any panel in their sight (The max length on that map - 1920 units)
			The average maximum practical distance in that map is ~1000 units, even if code-wise it is set to 9999 units.

Basic mechanics:
	Move Up:
		Move 32 	= arm panel moves half a panel / 32 units upwards. 	
		Move 64 	= arm panel moves 1 panel / 64 units upwards.		== Will be considered as a default location for Move Up panels, defined as Default
		Move 128 	= arm panel moves 2 panels / 128 units upwards.		
		Move 192	= arm panel moves 3 panels / 192 units upwards.		== DOESN'T EXIST AS OF 01.11.2025
		Move 224 	= arm panel moves 3.5 panels / 224 units upwards (as of 01.11.2025, this is a really janky mechanic. Player can hardly move upwards with it, and the panel visually detaches from the arm.)
	
	Move Angled:
		Move Angled Front  	= arm panel moves to the direction of +X axis (according to the _example_chamber_.vmf). The side however depends on which direction the arm panel model has been moved in Hammer.	Will be considered as a default location for Move Side panels, defined as Default Side.
		Move Angled Back			= arm panel moves to the direction of -X axis (according to the _example_chamber_.vmf). The side however depends on which direction the arm panel model has been moved in Hammer.	

		Cubesucker / Cubesaver	= saves a cube / prop thrown into the floor variant, and loads back the cube / prop from the ceiling variant. Does not do anything when pointing at walls.	

		Faithpanel				= arm panel that launches the player into a direction they are looking at, and then immediately retracts. Maximum achievable height from a single panel - >256 units (Can stop the player or even make them stuck if using too much of it. Can also be used as a speedrunning mechanic.)

Instructions:	
	Move Up:
		Move 32 + Up Arrow == Move 64 (Default)
		Move 64 (Default) + Up Arrow == Move 128
		Move 128 + Up Arrow == Move 224
		Move 224 + Down Arrow == Move 128
		Move 128 + Down Arrow == Move 64 (Default)
		Move 64 + Down Arrow == Move 32
	
	Move Angled:
		[Any Move Up position] + Right Arrow == [Last saved Move Angled position. By default - Move Angled Front (Default Side)]
		Move Angled Front (Default Side) + Down Arrow == Move Angled Back
		Move Angled Back + Up Arrow == Move Angled Front (Default Side)
		Move Angled Front, OR Move Angled Back + Left Arrow == [Last saved Move Up position. By default - Move 64]
		Move Angled Front, OR Move Angled Back + Right Arrow == Cubesucker
		Cubesucker + Right Arrow == Faithpanel
		Faithpanel + Left Arrow == Cubesucker / Cubesaver
		Cubesucker + Left Arrow == [Last saved Move Angled position. By default - Move Angled Front (Default Side)]

Possible puzzle mechanics:
	Player Raising (If Move Up will be activated below the player, they will move upwards.)
	
	Cube Saving (Cubesucker, requires a minimum of 4 floor panels and ceiling panels positioned in a square formation)
		No Cubesaving (No area that supports the Cubesucker)
	
	Remote Cube Recycle (Ceiling Cubesucker pointed at a goo, destroying the saved cube)

	Parkour	(QUICK REACTION TIME REQUIRED DUE TO PANELS RETRACTING QUICKLY WHEN ACTIVATED MULTIPLE PANELS)
		Wall Climbing   = Activating a wall panel where the player is standing and quickly jumping) (UNRELIABLE DUE TO THE PLAYER HAVING A HIGH CHANCE OF BEING KNOCKED OFF) 
			Panel Bridges (If a wall arm has a panel bigger than the default 64x64 unit panel, it can work as a reliable bridge)
		Jumping on Raised Platforms

	Cube Catapults
		Vertical Cube Catapult (Move Up mechanic raised below the cube, capatulting it up) (UNRELIABLE DUE TO SOURCE PHYSICS)
		Horizontal Cube Catapult (Move Side mechanic raised on a cube's side, catapulting it sideways) (MORE RELIABLE, BUT STILL SOURCE PHYSICS)
			HCC Button Cube Removing (HCC performed on a cube with an activated button, which will remove the cube from it)
		VCC Then HCC	 (VCC IS UNRELIABLE DUE TO SOURCE PHYSICS)

	Barricade (Panel raised to block something. I.e. Bridge, Funnel, Laser, Cube Falling, etc.)
	
	Player Catapult / Faithpanel (Use the Faithpanel to jump across a relatively small yet considerable distance. For example: a small gap, a higher platform, etc.)
	
Proposed Ideas (3 status types - Considering, Approved, Declined):
	IF MOVE SIDE WILL BE UPDATED TO INCLUDE ITS EXTENSION VARIANTS, LIKE THE MOVE UP VARIANTS:		[CONSIDERING]
		Extended Panel Platform (Walkable platforms in mid-air from the walls, less reliance on the floor panels.)
		
		Extended Barricade (Can stop things in mid-air and far away from any surface.)
		
	IF PANELS WILL BE UPDATED TO INCLUDE PANEL REVERSAL:		[APPROVED]
		Panel Reversal (Retract the existing already extended panels in the map. Can increase the speed of a fling if an extended panel at the bottom is reversed, and more.)
	
	Move Angled update to also include the Y axis directions could increase the puzzle potential.    [DECLINED (no animation for that)]
	
	Move Diagonal is an idea. The need of it is however unknown as of now:			[CONSIDERING]
		Falling cubes with a Diagonal panel underneath can make the cube fall into a desired location
		
		Diagonal panel with gel on it.
		
		Diagonal lasers, bridges, funnels and others.
	
	The current controls are a bit confusing and need to be changed. [APPROVED]
