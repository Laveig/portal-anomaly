Welcome to Portal Anomaly's private repository.    
If you're not a member of the team, please keep our hard work a secret or you're gay lmao.

How to use panels:
1) Download all the instances from the `anomaly` folder. (todo: add the instances)
2) Download all the scripts from the `scripts` folder.
3) Download the config from the `cfg` folder.
4) Copy the content into your map. *Do not use them as instances*, they breaks fsr.
5) To multiply the panels, use `Copy Paste Special`, or `ctrl + shift + v` on Windows. They will get a unique number this way. Note - if you just copypaste them, they will be treated as a single panel, which is useful for making a singular panel seen in the overgrown example.
6) Remember that `arm-floor*` are the floor panels, `arm_wall*` are the wall panels, and `arm_ceiling*` are the ceiling panels. Mixing them is not forbidden but strongly unrecommended, since idk probably something uses these prefixes in the code.
7) When you're done, simply compile the map. When you're in the map, type `exec anomaly`, and it will bind the following buttons:  q - toggle;  mouse3 (middle mouse button) - deploy the panel;  left/right arrow keys - change the mode;  up/down arrow keys - increase/decrease value (distance, angle, etc).
8)
